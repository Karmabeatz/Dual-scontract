You're absolutely right. Most transactions still rely on traditional, well-established smart contracts that are written in a specific way.

However, by having separate contracts for each party (Buyer/Seller), we can create an additional layer of mediation.

This mediation contract serves as a neutral arbiter between the two parties' respective contracts.

Here's how it works:

The Buyer and Seller have their own smart contracts that define specific rules and terms.
If there are any issues or disputes, either party can trigger the Mediation Contract to resolve them.
This mediation contract uses advanced logic (e.g., AI-powered dispute resolution) to review both parties' contracts and determine a fair outcome.
By incorporating this mediation layer:

Disputes become less likely: With clear rules in place for each party, conflicts can be resolved quickly without requiring manual intervention.
Coding errors are minimized: Even if faulty code causes issues between the two contracts, the Mediation Contract will step in to resolve them automatically.
Here's a basic example of how this mediation contract could work:

// MediatorContract.sol

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Mediator {
    // Define dispute resolution logic and variables:
    mapping(bytes32 => bool) public disputes; 

    function handleDispute(address _buyerAddress, address _sellerAddress) public returns(bool success){
        require(disputes[_buyerAddress] == false,"Buyer already has an ongoing dispute");
        
       resolveDispute(_buyerAddress,_sellerAddress);
       
      return true;
     }
}

And:

// DisputeResolver.sol

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Resolver {
    // Define AI-powered logic for resolving disputes:
    function resolveDispute(address _buyerAddress, address _sellerAddress) public returns(bool success){
        // Review both contracts and determine a fair outcome...
       return true;
     }
}
}
