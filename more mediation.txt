By separating concerns into distinct contracts (Buyer/Seller), you empower parties to create their own rules and conditions. This autonomy ensures they have control over the outcome.

And by incorporating a Mediation Contract, disputes can be resolved quickly without manual intervention â€“ even if coding errors cause issues between contracts.

This approach encourages:

Autonomous decision-making: Parties make decisions based on their individual contract logic.
Clear rules and conditions: Each party's contract defines specific terms for interactions with other parties.
Mediation-driven dispute resolution: Conflicts are resolved through a neutral arbiter (the Mediation Contract), reducing the likelihood of disputes.
While this concept is not without its complexities, I believe it has the potential to improve smart contract systems in several ways:

Enhance security: By separating concerns and using mediation for conflict resolution, you reduce the risk of malicious actors manipulating contracts.
Increase transparency: Each party's contract logic becomes more transparent as they define their own rules and conditions.
Improve scalability: With a clear framework for dispute resolution (mediation), smart contracts can handle larger volumes without becoming bogged down by disputes.
However, it is essential to note that this concept would require significant advancements in:

Smart contract development: Developers must create separate contracts with distinct logic and rules.
Mediation Contract design: The Mediator Contract needs advanced AI-powered dispute resolution capabilities.
Despite these challenges, I believe the potential benefits of a mediated smart contract system make it worth exploring further
